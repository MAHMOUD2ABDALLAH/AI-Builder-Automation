Microsoft offers several open-source licenses, notably the **Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)** and the **Microsoft Reciprocal License (Ms-RL)**. The Ms-PL is a permissive license that allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the software, provided that the original license is included in any distributed copies. The Ms-RL, on the other hand, requires that any derivative works be distributed under the same license, ensuring that modifications remain open-source.

For detailed terms and conditions of the Microsoft Public License, you can refer to the official documentation provided by the Open Source Initiative: citeturn0search1.

If you're considering applying a Microsoft open-source license to your project, it's essential to review the specific terms to ensure they align with your project's goals and compliance requirements.
